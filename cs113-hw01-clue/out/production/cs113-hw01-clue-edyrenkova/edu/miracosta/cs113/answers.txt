RandomClue:
1. I was not patient enough to get the successful result for each of the tests. I only managed to get <=20 for second
test once. The algorithm seems to be working bad for any of the test.
2. Cons: The algorithm does not save any knowledge from previous attempts. There are so many combinations possible so
pure guessing by choosing random is inefficient
Pros: Simple, could work for smaller amount of possible answers.

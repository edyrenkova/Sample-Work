RandomClue:
1. I was not patient enough to get the successful result for each of the tests. I only managed to get <=20 for second
test once. The algorithm seems to be working bad for any of the test.
2. Cons: The algorithm does not save any knowledge from previous attempts. There are so many combinations possible so
pure guessing by choosing random is inefficient
Pros: Simple, could work for smaller amount of possible combinations.

MyClue:
1.The result is always less than 20. Because starts from [1,1,1] and increments the way through, the first answer set
is always guessed in one attempt, the second answer set - in 20 attempts and 3rd one varies.
2. The algorithm is the most efficient solution to the problem possible. Efficiently tries all the possible combinations using the information given by tester.
